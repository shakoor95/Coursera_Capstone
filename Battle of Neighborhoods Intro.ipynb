    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s discuss the above mentioned problem. As New York city have 5 boroughs and each borough have its own neighborhoods. So, let’s say John got a job or he is a student that’s why he is planning to move New York city. Before coming here, he should have rough idea about the rents going in the city. That’s why we have to scrap the data from different sites to get approx. average rents for various neighborhoods. Once he’ll get familiar with neighborhoods and their rents, then it’s time for him to decide which neighborhood will better match with his everyday needs. For this reason, we have to introduce data for NYC and have to use Foursquare API to get venues. Let’s say we’ll explore Brooklyn,NY in this problem. So we should have longitude/latitude of Brooklyn. Then we have to develop data sets of every neighborhood. Then we have to find out each neighborhood have which restaurant, café, coffee shops, gyms different cuisines as NYC is multicultural city. \n",
